# ke

## Short description
`ke` is a free and open source compact / lightweight terminal text editor for Unix-like operating systems.

## Instalation & Usage
```sh 
 $ git clone "https://github.com/kickhead13/ke.git"
 $ cd ./ke/
 $ ./scripts/ke_build.sh
 $ ./target/ke --help
```

## Acknowledgements
`ke` is heavly inspired by the more popular (and overall better) `vim` (and its younger gork 'nvim'). However `ke` is not really a fork of vim since it doesn't share any code with either of the above.
